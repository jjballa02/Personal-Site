                <h2>Golfing</h2>
                <p>Golf has become my addiction for the past 6 years. I'm fairly certain I replaced basketball with golf. <br>
                It's a sport that can never be mastered and can have so many high's and low's to it that it is very humbling at times. <br>
                I've been able to play some of the best courses in the world and have met some amazing people along the way. <br>
                I'm always looking to improve my game and have been fortunate enough to be able to play as often as I do. <br>
                And for the next question, I'm a 4 handicap.

                <h2>Spending Time With Family</h2>
                <p>My family is everything to me! My daughters are two goofballs and always up to something. <br>
                I try and spend as much time as I can with my wife and kids doing different things and experiencing different joys in life. <br>
            There's nothing better than coming home from work and having my daughters run and give me the biggest hugs, or hearing the "gossip" from school.</p>

                <h2>Music Production</h2>
                <p>When it comes to music, it's something that I randomly stumbled upon. <br>
                I love to play piano, sing, produce different types of beats like Rap and R&B. <br>
            Music provides an escape where I can produce a track or make a song and get lost for hours.</p>
